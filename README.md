# PROG6002 - Programming the Internet of Things 
## Week 4 Smart Waste Terminal

This is an initiative to turn old smart phones and tablet into a smart waste terminal through a no-build browser application. It uses on-device object detection to classify rubbish. It shows which kerbside bin an item belongs in: 🔴 red (general waste), 🟡 yellow (recycling) or 🟢 green (food & garden organics). Everything runs in the browser with TensorFlow.js. The app then publishes the label, bin, confidence and timing metadata  via MQTT to control the attached phisical smart bin; it does not publish camera images.

## What students learn

1. Load an exported pre-trained model (`model.json`, weights and `metadata.json`).
2. Request the rear camera and run inference locally.
3. Reject low-confidence and unstable predictions.
4. Publish a structured JSON result over MQTT WebSockets.
5. Observe reconnect state, message timing and old-device performance. 

## How it works: object → bin

By default (*Pipeline*: **Detect the object, bin from its COCO label**):

1. **Detect.** [COCO-SSD](https://github.com/tensorflow/tfjs-models/tree/master/coco-ssd) (lite MobileNetV2, Apache-2.0, `models/coco-ssd-lite/`, 9 MB) finds everyday objects in the camera frame and draws a box around each one.
2. **Pick the item.** Objects mapped to *Ignore* (people and hands, animals, vehicles, furniture) are dropped. The largest remaining object is the item being shown.
3. **Look up the bin.** The object's COCO label (for example `bottle`, `cup`, `banana`, `laptop`) decides the bin through the mapping in [`bins.js`](bins.js).
4. **No object, no message.** If nothing is detected, the app shows **No item** and publishes nothing.

| Bin | Default COCO objects |
|---|---|
| 🟡 Yellow: recycling | bottle, book |
| 🟢 Green: food & garden organics | banana, apple, orange, broccoli, carrot, sandwich, hot dog, pizza, donut, cake |
| 🔴 Red: general waste | cup, wine glass, bowl, cutlery, vase, scissors, toothbrush, soft toys, bags, sports gear |
| ⚪ No kerbside bin: e-waste drop-off | laptop, cell phone, keyboard, mouse, remote, microwave, toaster, hair drier, clock |

Cups go to red because takeaway cups are plastic-lined and mugs are ceramic; drinking glasses are also not kerbside-recyclable. Electronics are not allowed in any kerbside bin, so they get their own grey result rather than red.

**Councils differ.** Edit the defaults in `bins.js`, or open *Bin mapping* in the app and change any object's bin. In-app changes are saved on the device and highlighted; *Reset to defaults* restores `bins.js`. Deciding and justifying these rules for your council is a good student exercise.

**Limitation:** COCO-SSD only knows 80 everyday object classes. It has no class for cans, boxes, crumpled paper or batteries, so these give **No item**. Setting *When nothing is detected* to **Classify the centre region instead** sends those frames to the material classifier; the message then records `"pipeline": "fallback"`.

The detector's weights were stored as float16 with `tools/quantize_tfjs_fp16.py`, halving the download from 18 MB. Its boxes and scores match the original float32 model to within 0.003.

## Train and use your own model

The app has three pipelines (*Pipeline* under *Classifier configuration*):

| Pipeline | What decides the bin | Training needed |
|---|---|---|
| **COCO object detection → bin** (default) | COCO's object label, e.g. `bottle` → yellow | None |
| **Image classifier** | Your Teachable Machine model's class, applied to the dashed target box | Yes |
| **COCO detection, then image classifier** | Your model's class, applied to the object COCO found | Yes |

To use Teachable Machine:

1. Train an image model with one class per item type or bin, **plus an `unknown` (or `background`) class** photographed with no item. Use varied lighting and backgrounds.
2. Export it as TensorFlow.js and copy the shareable link, for example `https://teachablemachine.withgoogle.com/models/MODEL_ID/`. The app adds `model.json` and `metadata.json` automatically. Alternatively, download the export and choose *Upload model files*.
3. Choose *Pipeline* → **Image classifier**, keep *Image classifier* → **Teachable Machine model URL**, paste the link and tap **Load model**.
4. Check **Bin mapping**. The model's classes are listed at the top. Class names containing a bin word are mapped automatically: `recycling`/`recycled`/`yellow` → yellow, `landfill`/`rubbish`/`red` → red, `organics`/`food`/`garden`/`green` → green, material names such as `plastic` or `paper` → yellow, and `unknown`/`background`/`nothing` → **No item**. Set any class marked *No bin rule* by hand; the log lists them after loading.

Model URLs must use `https://` (or `http://localhost` for local testing).

## Run it on a mobilephone or tablet

The page must be served over HTTPS for camera access. Opening `index.html` directly from Downloads is not reliable.

1. Upload this folder to GitHub Pages, an SCU HTTPS web server or another static HTTPS host.
2. Open the HTTPS URL in an updated Chrome browser on the tablet.
3. Keep the default COCO pipeline or load your Teachable Machine model (see above), and enter a unique device ID.
4. Use a broker that supports secure MQTT WebSockets. The example public endpoint is for classroom testing only.
5. Set the topic, for example `prog6002/2026/team01-tablet01/classification`.
6. Tap **Connect MQTT**, then **Publish test message**. Confirm it in the HiveMQ WebSocket client.
7. Tap **Start camera & model** and grant camera permission.
8. Present an item steadily and confirm that stable, confident classifications are published.
9. For a display tablet, tap **Tablet mode** in the header. Only the title, the video and the bin result stay on screen, and the page goes full screen where the browser allows it. In landscape, the video and result sit side by side. While stopped, a large **Start** button remains. The setting is remembered on the device; tap **Exit tablet mode** to see the settings again.

Buttons show whether they can be used: clickable buttons are solid and raised; unavailable ones are grey and dashed, with the reason written on them (for example *Publish test message · connect MQTT first*).

}
```

- `bin`: `red`, `yellow`, `green`, `ewaste`, or `null` when the label has no bin rule.
- `pipeline`: `coco` (COCO label decided the bin), `detect` (object detected, material classifier decided), `fallback` (nothing detected; the centre region was classified), or `classify` (detection switched off).
- `classification` is the label that decided the bin: the COCO object in `coco` mode, otherwise the classifier's material.
- `detected_object` is `null` unless an object was detected. `bbox` is `[x, y, width, height]` as fractions (0–1) of the camera frame.
- `alternatives` lists other detected objects (or runner-up classes) with their bins.
- `location` is `null` unless *Include GPS location* is ticked and a fix is available. `accuracy_m` combines the device's reported accuracy with the error added by rounding, `age_s` is how old the fix is, and `altitude_m` is `null` on most devices.
- Schema version 2 added `bin`, `bin_description` and `model` (which replaced `model_url`).

## Location (optional)

Tick **Include GPS location in messages** in the MQTT panel to add a `location` object to each message. The browser asks for permission once, and the page must be served over HTTPS.

- **Precision** sets how much the coordinates are rounded: ≈1 m (5 decimal places), ≈10 m (4), ≈100 m (3) or ≈1 km (2). Use the coarsest setting that still meets the need. Rounding is included in `accuracy_m`, so a ≈1 km setting reports about ±557 m even when the device's own fix is ±12 m.
- Tablets without GPS fall back to Wi-Fi or mobile positioning, which can be off by tens or hundreds of metres. Check `accuracy_m` before drawing conclusions from a location.
- With no fix yet, permission denied, or the box unticked, messages carry `"location": null`, so the format does not change.
- The *Location* row in *System state* shows the current fix or why there is none. Denying permission unticks the box.
- Privacy: location is personal information when it can be linked to a person. For a fixed bin terminal the position is a property of the bin, not of a person; for a hand-held tablet it tracks whoever carries it. Publish it only with a documented need and consent, and prefer coarse precision. This is a good discussion point for the unit's privacy content.

## Stability mechanism

The result is published only when:

- the confidence reaches the configured threshold (default 0.6; COCO scores for clearly visible objects are typically 0.6–0.95);
- the same label and bin occur for the configured number of consecutive frames (default 3); and
- the class has changed, or the cooldown has expired (default 5 seconds).

This reduces flicker and unnecessary MQTT traffic. Students should benchmark thresholds and stable-frame counts against accuracy, latency and message volume rather than copying the defaults without evidence.

## Important notes

- Camera access normally requires HTTPS and user permission.
- The app requests 640 x 480 and limits inference to approximately four runs per second to reduce load. Detection plus classification is roughly twice the work of classification alone; check the *Inference* time on your tablet.
- The first start on an old tablet can take several seconds while both models are prepared for the GPU; the status shows *Loading models…*.
- Older tablets may terminate the tab when memory is low. Close other tabs and lower camera resolution or inference frequency if needed.
- Keep the screen awake during demonstrations; browser background tabs are throttled.
- Internet access is needed for the CDN libraries, the Teachable Machine model (if used) and the public broker. The bundled models are served with the app. For offline deployment, download and serve dependencies and model files locally.
- Location needs HTTPS and user permission, and drains battery while the camera runs; leave it off unless the data is needed.
- Browser-stored MQTT credentials are visible to the device user. Use a restricted teaching account and topic permissions.

## Suggested tutorial tests

| Test | Evidence |
|---|---|
| Manual MQTT test | JSON appears on the exact subscribed topic |
| Known item under good lighting | Correct class, confidence and inference time |
| Empty scene | *No item*, and nothing is published |
| Bottle, banana, cup, phone | Yellow, green, red and *No kerbside bin* respectively |
| Change a rule in *Bin mapping* | The new bin is shown and published; the row is marked as changed |
| Item COCO does not know (can, box) | *No item*; with the centre-region fallback, a `fallback` message instead |
| Confidence just below threshold | No publication |
| Rapid class changes | Consecutive-frame rule suppresses flicker |
| Network disconnection | MQTT state changes and reconnects after restoration |
| Old tablet benchmark | Median inference time and approximate messages/minute |
| Location on/off | `location` is an object when ticked with a fix, `null` when unticked or denied |
| Location precision | Coarser settings round the coordinates and raise `accuracy_m` |

## Production limitations

This is a teaching prototype. A production system needs a private authenticated broker, TLS certificate validation, restrictive topic access, locally hosted/pinned dependencies, model version identifiers, privacy review, device management and stronger offline handling. Do not publish images, personal information or precise location data without a documented need and appropriate consent.
